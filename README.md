# [My First Website](https://matthewhopwood.github.io/my-first-website/) and README

In this project I was was following a video guide provided by my course for full stack web development. 
I was challenged to finish off a basic tutor led project by identifying many different languages and frameworks that
I will be working with for the rest of course. I had to create 3 webpages with 6 images of the corresponding language and frameworks
as well as links to the corresponding wikipedia pages.
